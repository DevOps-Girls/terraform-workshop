# Summary

*Let's wrap up what we have learnt!*


* Terraform is just one of the ways you can implement infrastructure as code.

* Terraform uses the AWS API, instead of Cloudformation.

* To collaborate effectively, you need to set up a remote state backend - there's lots of ways to do this too.

* We configured an s3/DynamoDB remote state back end.

* Terraform picks up the configuration from the files you create ending in `.tf`

* You can use `.tfvars` files to separate out variable values, for example dev and prod.

* It is easy to run terraform commands to manage your stack.
